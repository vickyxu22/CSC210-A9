# Binary Search Tree

For this project you will implement four operations on a binary search tree:  lookup, insert, delete (using copy left), and left/right rotations.  These are defined in the `BST_Ops` interface.

Begin by creating class `BST` that extends `BinaryTree`.  Your BST class will be generic on a base type that implements the `Comparable` interface, so that you can perform the necessary comparisons on the elements.  Make sure that your new class also implements `BST_Ops` and copy the method signatures into it as stubs.

Fill out the methods for the four operations and test them thoroughly to make sure they work.
